This Mod brings you Mondstadt civilization from Genshin Impact and 3 leaders: Fischl, Barbara, and Noelle.

Unique District: Knights of Favonius Headquater, which replaces Government Plaza and has outer defence. It provides you bonus amenities during peacetime.

Unique Unit: Out-rider Knight that replaces Skrimisher (or Scout in RaF). Wind Gliders give them +1 move starting a turn on hills.

Genshin Building: Statue of the Seven, which replaces Monument and provides extra faith. It also heals units instantly upon stepping onto it.

Genshin Improvement: Adventurers' Guild. It provides bonuses to its tile and surrounding tiles.

This Mod also contains 40+ minutes of BGM from the Genshin Impact game. They're divided into 4 eras and will play alongside other civilizations' music.

[*][b]Unique Geological Names[/b]
Enjoy the fun of exploration, and name your newly discovered mountains, rivers, lakes... all in Teyvat's style.

[*][b]Hilichurl Barbarian Skins[/b]
Continue your daily rival and struggle with Hilichurls, as they now spawn as barbarians everywhere in the wildlands. (visual effects only)

[*][b]Healing from Statue of the Seven[/b]
Yep, it works just like in Genshin Impact. (with sound effects too!) Step a unit onto it and instantly get healed.

[*][b]All Assets with Proper Model[/b]
No model art is left behind. All assets are visible and clear in game, including the Statue of the Seven.[/list]
