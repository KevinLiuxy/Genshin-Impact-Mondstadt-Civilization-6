Thanks largely to her unique ability — and, to a lesser extent, to her own effort and peculiar personality — Fischl quickly went from the rookie investigator of the Adventurers' Guild to a respected rising star of the organization. She's certainly done well for herself. She only landed the coveted position of Investigator at age fourteen in the first place because her parents managed to persuade the guild master.

Their first encounter was mentioned in &quot;Flowers for Princess Fischl (I): End Time Zersetzung&quot; When the lone pilgrimaging princess reached the kingdom of eternal twilight, the fate-resisting royals chose to deny everything in their desperation. They refused to recognize Fischl's noble stature and mission as the princess of the Immernachtreich; denied their 13,000-year lineage as a branch of the royal family; and forsook their own nobility and restraints as humans... devolving into clumsy and vicious beasts. In the palace of Twilight and amidst the teeth of the beasts, the princess shed her sacred blood on the ancient emblem. At the moment of her peril, the dark wings of the night ripped the trapped, wounded princess from her despair and took her under its wings. Following the scent of her noble blood, Ozvaldo Hrafnavins, the King of Ravens came to the princess and pledged his eternal loyalty."

She spent most of her childhood in the library, traversing the countless universes that were contained in the pages of the library books. She became the ruler of the Immernachtreich, summoned Thundering Retribution as a royal princess, and formed a soul bond with a Raven... &quot;Amy, what books did you read today?&quot; Her parents asked her on one of the rare occasions that they were home between adventures. She proceeded to tell them the story she had read from her favorite series. &quot;...And then he said, Fischl von Luftschloss Narfidort, you are the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, my proud daughter. You shall never surrender your nobility and dreams.&quot; &quot;Oh, that's a lovely story. Since you like it so much, Amy, how about I call you 'Fischl' too?&quot; Her father smiled, put his hand on her head and repeated the words from the story to her. &quot;Fischl, you are my wonderful princess and my proud daughter. You shall never surrender your nobility and dreams.&quot; These kind and loving words lit up her world. However, the time with her busy parents was always fleeting. Unable to fit in with her peers due to her obsession with fantasy novels, she often felt lonely and sad. At these times, she would remind herself: &quot;I am Fischl, my daddy's wonderful princess. It's true, because Mommy and Daddy said so...&quot; &quot;Never will I surrender my nobility and dreams, for they are... a princess' rite of passage.&quot;"

On her fourteenth birthday, those of her peers who refused to accommodate her quirks belittled her once again. &quot;This is but a minor setback for the noble princess. My parents will understand,&quot; she thought to herself. For if she knew one thing, it was that as a princess she could never surrender her nobility and dreams. But when she threw herself into her parents' arms in need of comfort, she was met instead with gentle words of exasperation. &quot;Amy, you are fourteen years old now. It's fun to make-believe, but eventually you need to grow up and put your childish dreams behind you...&quot; And with that, the same voice that had once lit up her world now tore it apart. That day at midnight, she hid herself in the library she knew so well. She had a strange feeling that she was being watched... Suddenly, she heard an otherworldly flapping of wings. Sure enough, she looked up and her red, swollen eyes met with those of a night raven from another world. What transpired afterwards is another story... Fischl doesn't much like this story. Thinking about it causes her to feel suffocating pain and soul-devouring loneliness. Maybe one day, this story will be written. But that would be Amy's story, not Fischl's. Fischl has but one identity: she's the Prinzessin. As long as she remembers this simple and perfect logic, with a little bit of nobility and a touch of kindness from others, nothing can ever hurt her.

He disguised himself as an honest merchant with his family on a business trip to Mondstadt. Naturally, with them being visitors from afar, Noelle gave them a warm reception. Initially, the merchant was delighted with Noelle's hospitality; it was a cut above the crude etiquette he had come to expect from most peasants in Mondstadt. However, after a while he began to feel that something was amiss. Noelle seemed to be able to read his mind: She correctly guessed his schedule, cooked his family's favorite Snezhnayan dishes for them each day, and even knew that his daughter liked to go to bed hugging a ragdoll, presenting her with a hand-made doll she had sewn together herself. This spooked the merchant, and made him hesitant to execute the next phase of his plan. Noelle's warm smile now chilled the merchant to the bone. What else did she know, and what was she really planning? In the end, the merchant fled Mondstadt with his family. Noelle was upset for a few days, thinking she had somehow insulted her guests.

It was impossible to find a safe route to proceed, to say nothing of saving the adventurer amidst the snow. However, Noelle persisted on searching for the adventurer and eventually found him inside a cave, suffering from severe hypothermia. At the time, her coat was completely soaked, and the water inside her bottle had turned to ice. Thirsty and hungry, Noelle still managed to carry the adventurer down on her back. The adventurer was saved, but Noelle, having over-exerted herself, laid in bed for three days straight, suffering from a high fever. Everyone in the Knights of Favonius barely slept out of concern for her during that period. Fortunately, Noelle recovered. It was not the first or second time that something similar had happened, and everyone was deeply worried for Noelle. In order to prevent Noelle from putting herself in harm's way again, Jean had to invent some safe jobs to keep Noelle busy. If something were to happen, then Kaeya would have to save the day. During the Stormterror threat, Noelle was also eager to resolve the threat at its source. However, Kaeya managed to arrange quite a few &quot;urgent matters&quot; for her to attend to inside the city until it was all over."

			 Text="Noelle's petite form does a good job of hiding her great strength. This does not just refer to her resoluteness or her indomitable spirit, but also her physical strength. Once, Lisa accidentally dropped her experimental apparatus under her bookshelf and troubled over whether she could remain decent while bending over to retrieve it. Noelle made it over in the nick of time, lifting the full bookshelf with only one hand — and not a single book fell out between her hefting it and putting it down. There was another incident in which several cargo-bearing carts were attacked by Pyro Slimes as they tried to pass through Mondstadt's side gate. As the owners were all in a panic, it was Noelle again who came to the rescue — hurling the carts — cargo and all, into the Cider Lake, before leaping into the water herself and retrieving every last item. Rumor has it that when Noelle was studying the blade, she nearly sent Wagner — who prided himself in his forging skills — into despairing seclusion. In all, he forged over ten different swords with different alloy compositions for Noelle, but all would lose their edge after a few uses. At first, Wagner thought Noelle unskilled, but eventually found that the problem was more foundational: the swords just weren't strong enough. Putting his reputation on the line, Wagner finally made Noelle a sturdy and heavy claymore that was further reinforced by her affinity for Geo. Only then was her weapon issue (barely) solved. But don't worry, Noelle won't use her superhuman strength unless the situation calls for it, as she is a pacifist at heart. They say, however, that the very day Noelle received her custom-made claymore, she was set upon by a pair of drunken Treasure Hoarders in Drunkard Gorge, who thought her a harmless lamb... Let's just hope that no one else will ever be so unlucky."

			 Text="Noelle's greatest enemy, curiously, is not a person, but Ludi Harpastum itself. During Ludi Harpastum, long tables arranged in a circular shape and filled with all kinds of food will be set up in the plaza before the Cathedral for everyone to enjoy. The food is usually prepared by volunteers who can cook. During this time, Noelle, who always holds herself to a high standard, joins the volunteers in continuously cooking and serving food. It's not really any additional work; what's difficult is that she insists on tasting every dish to make sure they are up to standard. The crispy Moon Pies; the sizzling Mondstadt Pork Chops; the towering Pile 'Em Ups — all the fried and barbecued foods, equal parts delicious and fatty, are customary at the festival. The smiles on people's faces make Noelle truly happy. What makes her less so is seeing her bulging belly. She can't help but let out a sigh. For the entire month following the festival, Noelle will volunteer for the Knights of Favonius' city night patrol. The festival may be over, but her battle is only beginning."
